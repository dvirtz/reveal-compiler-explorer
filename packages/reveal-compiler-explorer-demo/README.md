This is a demo of the [reveal-compiler-explorer](../reveal-compiler-explorer/README.md) and [reveal-test](../reveal-test/README.md) packages.

It uses [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) to generate a [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) presentation from markdown files.

For viewing the demo presentation click [here](https://dvirtz.github.io/reveal-compiler-explorer) or run locally

```
npm run present
```

if you're inside `reveal-compiler-explorer-demo` or

```
npx lerna run present
```

if you're inside the project root.

Test the presentation's code samples with:

```js
npm test
```

from inside `reveal-compiler-explorer-demo`.
